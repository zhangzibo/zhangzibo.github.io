                              <p>for along time, putting stories/ journals of mine on the internet for everone to see is quite weird, but here it is, a start.</p>

<br />
<em>the room, translated from memory</em></p>

<p>after the bell rang, the boy charged out of school. he wanted to get away from his classmates so he walked around on purpose and then swiftly walked into a nearby park. the park is like every other park, no one really walk around in it and the only people who spend time in it is a few old people doing their daly excercise , the tai-chi, scattered doing their old people things. The boy ducked down and slipped into a short pile of bushes, suprisingly, there is a window right behind the bushes. he pushed over the window and inside it, is his own perosnal kingdom. </p>



<p>the room is only a few sqare feet big, probably a old abondoned storage room people has left behind and forgotten about. the boy only found out about it randomly trying to waiting out the rain. During the time there are pieces of scratch paper, crambled up magazines all over the place, the window frames are full of dust, a spider has already made his home onit. The corners of the house lies a broken coffee table and bambo chair with brooken seats. maybe beacause the owners thought they could always come back, they have left he door wide open, and the boy has gotten in with no trouble at all. the boy quickly realized that this was a abondoned place, on the coffee table, he even found a apir of keys thats full of dust. he kept his excitment down and shakendly tries to open the door with that pair of key, with a clicking sound lock bounced open. suddenly a exciting but absurb idea came to him, but it became more and more realistic as he thought about it more. this place is a place people left behind, forgotten about. he has found a piece of treasurly island, he could own it, a place of his and his alone. </p>



<p>the boy has enver realy gotten along with other children. when the other boys are playing in the street, he likes to spend most his time hanging around his mother. stutterly reading "the knights of the cross" while arguing who Zbyszko really loves. the boy remembered, while him and his mother discussed these things, her eyes are full of life and excitement, even though, his fatehr always have to obligatoryly say how come he is not out there playing soccer with the boys. the children in his neightbothood never really likeed him neither, whenever they see him walking by, words like "nerd" is spitted at him and following with with the sound of soccer and whistle. the boy is glad now he owns a kingdom of his own, his own world.</p>

<p>this day the boy has come to the room, wanting to write a letter for his mom. a year ago, he mother left him to go to the far far north. his parents was divoreced. mother really wanted to live with the boy, and the boy even told Mr. judge he wanted the same thing. but with a few words -- "no finicial capablity", the boys' dream is destoryed.</p>
 
<p>the boy lifts up his head, the voice of children playing and fooling arond came to him. from the look, anyone could tell that he really wanted to fit in and play with them. at the same time he knows the truth, if he appeared suddenly and ask to join them, however sincere he could be, the seclusion still exists. like the werid old man people has warn their kids about, living a few house down, snacks, cartoons, and toys could only work for so long. the boy never understood, not even his most loving mother could explain: why do the group of boys could allow themselves hanging with someone who spits whenever they fight, or even hanging with the crazy kid who bites randomly, but not him.</p>

<p> just like this, the boy has always come to his room of his. never could fit in, the longer he spents in the room, he realized that the only thin that could accpet him unconditionally is this room. he thought he could no longer live without this room, here he doesn't need anyone. no one could make him unhappy, no one could lecture him. here everything belongs to him. he lift up his hand, trying to write the letter, he wanted to say so much to his mom. the things they always talks about, the dreams he always imagined. he has never gotten close to father, he couldnt. his fater is always busy, busy coming in the house, busy eating, busy talking, even busy at getting mad at him. he kept on writng about the new friend he has made in his class, a transfer, hes new and just like the boy, without much friends. </p>


<p>along with a heavy sign, he put the letter in the very end of his desk drawer, in there are 20 something letters just like this one. he really wanted to send them out, he really do, but he can't, his father never told him where his mom lived. even the letter his mom send him, he has neer gotten to see them. the only thing that he could wish to dream about his mom is to write these letter behind his fathers back. </p>

<p> after been apart his mom for almost a year, he no longer feels the dreadness and hollowness. espcially when he made his new friend. as is life has gotten a lot more lively, visits to room became less and less.</p>

<p>the boy has brought a soccer ball --- today him and his new friend decided to play some socce. while kicking the ball mindlessly, his face shows some worries: should he telll his new friend about the secert room of his? think about all the things they could do in there, they could work on homework together, read, cook. the boy alwasy wanted to share the secert he has found, even thought he wrote letters to his mom about it, but the letters could never reach her hands, and the room only ever his lonely shadow. he even thought about telling his friend about the room a few times, but never found himself sayingit out lout. after awhile hes decided during break he could bring his friend along, then it wont attact so much atttention.</p>

<p>the friend is already waiting on him at the soccer field, he saw the boy running to him with excitement and said "great!, hey look there are poeple here playing too!"</p>
<p>a frown begin to appear on the boy's face. it is the group of boys, they still wound twant to hang with the boy, even thought they werent as hostile as they were before. but rejction has become normal to the boy and he has found himself in the same position he was not so long ago</p>

<p>"lets go over there and play", the boy points at a small empty field on the other side of the crowd.</p>

<p>"why not play with them?" the friend asks with some couriosity "isnt it more fun?"</p>

<p> the boy looks down at the ball, he wants to explain why, but dont know where to start. at last, a low and quiet voice murmurs out "I never play with them."</p>

<p>that day, it's the first time the two did not have much fun. especailly the friend, always seems like his occupied with something else on his mind, a few time the ball has been kicked almost purposely over the fence. and when the boy has pick up the ball he saw his fried laughing with the group of boys...</p>

<p> a week later.</p>

<p>the boy is watching TV, and the father is flippig through the paper. </p>

<p>"that friend of yours, you know the tall looking boy, how come i dont see him often anymore?" the fatehr asked carelessly "i saw him almost everyday before.</p>

<p>the boy made no noise, and only turned the television louder.</p>

<p>the father looks at the back of the boy, he has seen it before. almost immidiately he realized what has happened between the two.</p>

<p>the father werent so happy with his discorvery, he wanted to say something, but didn't. the boy must walk on his own, if he cant even find a friend, how coudl he even stand in this more and more competitive society. but the fahter has gotten a little tired of his lecturing. maybe it is better to let the boy learn some lessons, he is still young, and what is painful to him now might not be after a few years for him to look back. it would be better for him learn the hard lessons now then later. </p>
 
<p>the father wasnt wrong, the boy distant himself with his friend.</p>。

<p>the friend has quickly found his place withthe group of boys. hes not a bad looking lad, and even knows how to whistle, the boys in the neightborhood accpeted him almost immediately. of course the boy didnt break his friendship apart right then and there, after a long time of lonelynes he cared for the friendshi between him and his friend, and he cant help but to play with his firend and the group of boys, he it's so clear to him that his friend no longer look at the boy the same way as before. even when they are playing ball, the new friend starts to purposely make the boy pick up lose balls over the fence, even though they kick it over.</p>

<p>the last draw happened in school.</p>

<p>it's actually over a rather small and simple thing. during the time the boy was cleaning the black board, it's the friends duty that day to clean up, but looking at eh clock noticing it's almost tiem for the next class already, his friend is still talking swiftly to the girls, nociting it doesnt seem like it's going  stop, the boy trid to clean for his friend. while stading on the lecture podium, the boy clearly saw that his friend noticed him, and tunred around pretend not to notice him and continued his conversation with the girls. </p>

<p>it's schools rules that 3 minutes before the bell rings, no one should be walking in the class room, but beacause the cleaning took a little while, the boy walked to his desk a luttle late, right on time when the teacher walked in. the boy's teacher is   strict middle age woman, paid especial attention to the rules of the school. as soon as she saw him, the face has turned gloomy, "the class has already begun, what are you doing wondering around?"
the boy has always been sacered of the lady, he studdtterly said "i was just trying to clean the black board." </p>

<p> of the teacher was to let it go, nothing else was goning to happen, but she have a particular sharp memory and hated people lying. she raised her eyebrows and said "it's not your duty to clean the class today." the boy got nervous, he tried to explain" I was trying to do it for someone else..." " alright alright" she's getting impatient, jeered "oh so you were jsut trying to be a goos samaritan huh, then i shouldve congradulated you". after what she said he walked off and begin today's class.</p>

<p>the teacher obviously meant taht this will be the end of this. she didnt bother to quesiton it furthur. to her she has already let the boy go. but out of her expectation, the boy didnt jsut walk off, rather the opposite, he came up, said nervously but with a sense of certainty " i really was trying to help someone else doing their duty, if you dont blieve it, ask him", then the boy points at his friend, the friend didnt bother to stand up, not even mentioning to apologize. the teacher now is really getting mad, she harshly sid to the boy "you back to your seat now, and come to my office after class, this is rideiculous, lying to my face like that."</p>

<p>in the end the truth finally float out, the teacher even appologize dto the boy afte class for making assumptions about him, also punished the friend, and the friend tied to explain huimself by saying taht he only thought this was really nothing big, not worth stading over and answer for. to the boy, he could never forgive the friend for what he did, how could he? how could he forgive someone who has betrayed him when he was most needed. to the boy, the other dont deserve to be his friend. </p>

<p>sometimes the boy thought, the other boy never really wanted his friendshiip form the gecko, the other boy only befriended him because he was new in town, the otehr boy never really like him. the only thing the boy was glad about was that he didnt tell the other boy about his secert room. after what had happened, the boy cherished even more about his secert-the room shares his lonelyness with him, it keeps secerts for him, it fills the void in his life. only the room is dependable, it will never betary, never be lost.</p>

<p>it's the last of the middle, the boy was the same as before, standing apart from the crowd, even though he has changed alot. his taller now than his father, ther are evena few light sruffs above his lips, he is still strangly unsociablt as before, doesnt really join any extracurricular activities. it seems like he was only living in his world of imaginations, everything he did and the relationships he had with the outside world, however close it might seem, there is a invisible wall between him and the rest. the thing that he does the most in the room was writing. </p>

<p>as time went on, the boy start to guess why the room was even here in the first place. he imagined one day maybe he is boiling soup or something, someone will suddenyl appear, and they will say taht this room will be for public, the room will be torn down and rebuilt-- the idea of that is too real and cruel for him. so the boy starts to change a new hypothesis, maybe the door opens, there will be a woman, she was returning to her hometown and to this place of hers, full of her memory, maybe she would be foudnign her old diary or pictures or soemthing, maybe when she opens the door she will be shocked to see the boy, and then, he would walk up to her and say... everytime when he gets to this part, the boy could never imagine what he would say to the woman, maybe he could invite her to lve with him in this room, does it counts as a marraige then? thats too random and rediculous. the boy love to daydream about things like this, and even sometimes, the dreams he had, even he was stuned by it. he would would start to record all of it down. one day, while he was crazyly writing down his thought, he suddnely thoght this is what he should be: a writer.</p>

<p>the idea infested him, he would try to write short stories, and starts to use his free time in school to write. but this was discoveredd by his teacher very quickly. what supriesd the boy was the mindless suppression she have. not only did she took away two months worth of his work, she even called his fatehr about this sayig that it is" random, not a promising future, a extemely stupid idea". when the boy got home, the father apprehended him furiously </p>

<p>"you dont possibly think you could making a living out of this do you? why dont you ever just be normal and do your school work and leave it at that? it's your mom, it's her giving you stupid ideas like these when you are young. doing some usleess shit like this"</p>

<p>the boy tried to hold down his anger, lowering his head and didnt even made a sound. the second day he moved eveything in his room to the room. he begin to ditch class, spend days in there writing. the boy's grade became adownward slope, if nothing else happens, these life of seclusion may really take a toll on him. </p>

<p>the first thing of highschool is seperating classes, the advanced class and the regular class. the seperation of classes also mixed people around. the boy has made it to the advanced class, the classmates he had before are no longer with him. the boy was not reminiscient about it, he was quite pleased with it, the class he had before always made fun of him for his peculiarity. after making it to the advance class, everyone is so busy studying no one had the time make fun of him, not to mention talking at all with one another. he had more freedom than before. the new deskmate of his is a girl from a different class. the boy never liked to talk , and the girl like everyone else, care nothing else but o study. after a month or two, besides borrowing an eraser or asking for a difficult question, the boy and his deskmate never made any further in their relationship.</p>

<p>maybe the boy and the girl could jsut live peacfully like this, the occasion conversation and graduate with a distant relationship. but this was not the case.</p>

<p>it was a afternoon, after being jailled for half a day the boys did not even care to eat lunch, they are playing the fields. the girls are coupliig around and talking about the newest movie and making small conversations here and there. the boy is stting in the classroom along, slashing his pen around on the paper. a group of voice came outside of the window, a few words flow in the boy's ear, it was about him. he couldnt help but to eavedrop their conversation.</p>

<p>even thought the boy never really talks to anyone, the uniqueness of him not being around the crowd in the two months made the rest of the class intersted in him. some curious girls even asked about he boy from his former classmates. the group of voice was talking about how the boy was trying to helping someelse doinng their duty and got in trouble, starting to write novels out of the blue. as time went on, the boy has gotten more mad, he wanted to ran outside and teach those people how to mind their own business. but he thought about it and only chuckled with a sense of helplessness, he knew if he did anything, it will only be new material for people to talk about behind his back. for a long a time now he has forgiven those who misunderstood. but a voic, a defending voice suddenly came in the group of voices:</p>

<p>"i don think it was so funny what he did? he's pretty cool and quiet, and kind of smart. thats maybe just how he is. i saw one of his stories, legit one of the better stories ive read, probably the best writer in our class... "</p>

<p>it;s only after awhile did the boy realize that it was a voice of his deskmate, the girl. he remembered that the there was one time where he brought in his story to class trying fix the ending, he left it on his desk before going out, and when he came back the draft was out of order and all over the desk, at the time he thought it was the wind. the boy couldve never imagined it was her, someone who has only sit by him for 2 months, total of 100 word exchanged between the two, she knows him better than eveyrone else and even like his stories! everyone else has only ever rooted against him and anything that he did, the girl is the only one who stood on his side and given him some sympathy.  </p>


<p>from then on the boy saw something in her eyes, something undescribable. he starts to talk to her more and more. he doesnt go to the room often now, he enjoy spending more of his time with her in the room studying, the boringness he tried to get away from is not so boring now. even when they dont talk much, just sitting next to her has made him happy. and the girl also felt something, she didnt try to avoid it neither, but rather hang around with a naturally with some confidence</p>

<p>one day,, the girl was trying out a new fountain pen. perhaps something was blocking the ink, she shook it immpatiently, a string of ink flow out, right on to the boy's shirt. it was  new shirt and the stream of ink sure made its mark on it.  </p>

<p>the girl said anxiously "i.. i will bring the shirt and clean it for you, dont worry, i will give it to you perfectly clean tomorrow. alright?"</p>

<p>of course the boy agreed</p>

<p>the second day the girl came back with clean shirt, to his suprise, the mark was really gone, like it had never happened.</p>

<p>"wow you are good, whenver i geta  mark on my shirts, the washing machine never washes it off." the boy said with praise.</p>

<p>"the washing machines doesnt work on these kind of things", the girl told him "i used bits of rice to clean this, and then wash it three times in luke warm water."</p>

<p>"you wash it by hand?"</p>

“这是你亲手洗的?”少年更吃惊了。

“那当然，小时候我妈就教过我，墨水弄脏的衣服非得人工洗才洗得干净。”女孩不经意地说。

“你真了不起，连这种事都知道。”少年轻轻地叹了口气，“我上小学时妈就跟我爸离婚了，她从来没教过我这些。”少年勉强笑了笑，“不怕你笑话，我有好几件衣服因为弄上墨水洗不干净，都扔在衣橱里呢。”

女孩同情地看着少年，不知该说些什么安慰话。她别出心裁地蹦出个念头。

“哎，”她半开玩笑地说，“你把那些衣服拿来，我替你洗洗看，没准还能穿。不过到时候你得好好谢我。”

当女孩再一次把洗净的衣服带给少年时，他感动极了。少年很清楚，除了母亲，她是第一个给他以如此细腻关怀的人。少年时时穿女孩洗过的衣服，似乎那上面仍可感受到女孩留存的气息。少年心中涌起一股和他发现神秘小屋时一样的激动感情。
少年决定将这个世界上最爱的东西奉献给她。经过一番精心准备后，一天下午他带她来到了小屋。

时值4月底，天气还有些凉，但当阳光照在身上时，却颇为温暖和煦。窗外绿意满眼，不时传来声声鸟儿鸣唱。

女孩跟随少年穿过灌木丛翻进小屋后，就立刻眼花缭乱了。她在屋子里转了一圈又一圈，不时地惊叹着。“这可真够刺激的!”她叽里呱啦地说个不停，“这么说你一直就躲在这里了。怪不得别人总奇怪为什么老看不见你的人，原来你钻这儿了!”

少年涨红了脸：“你可不能告诉任何人。”

“那当然。这是属于咱们两人的秘密。这房子是谁家的?”女孩问。

“我不知道。”少年说，“自从发现这个地方，我从没见过别人来这儿。”

那一个下午，是少年在小屋里呆过的最愉快的时光，他们两人一起在小屋里品尝咖啡，读少年以前写的手稿，看着早到的燕子在屋檐下翻飞，而小屋也因为有了女孩的笑声，更添了勃勃生机。

晚上，少年刚吃完饭，就接到女孩打来的电话：“我有些东西要给你看。”女孩子已经和少年很亲密了。她常来他家，两人一块复习，累了就开上一小会儿玩笑。

很快女孩已坐在了少年书房里。

“这是什么?”少年翻着她带给自己的一叠卷子。

“这是今年考重点高中的英语试卷。”重点高中选拔考已成了每年学校仅次于考大学的一场生死竞争。也是每年这个时候，校园里总会冒出这一类试卷，持有人都声称这是泄露出来的真卷子，向居心不良的学生索要高价。今年的选拔考已经考了两天了，明天是考试的最后一天，考的就是英语。

“你怎么也信这个?”少年不屑一顾，“骗人的东西。前两天那些据说也是泄露出来的卷子不都证明是假的吗?”

女孩有些急：“这没准儿是真的，是我一个在教委里工作的伯伯带给我妈的。”

“就是真的又怎么样?我反正不会去作弊。”少年说着随手翻了翻卷子，立刻笑了起来，“我肯定这是假的，两天前我就在别的同学家里见过这试卷。我劝你还是别浪费时间了。”

“是吗?”女孩有点半信半疑，“反正看看也不会有坏处，我翻了一下觉得还是有一定难度的，好些范围老师以前根本没给我们复习到。”

“好吧，我抽空看看它。”少年又神秘地对女孩说，“明天考完试，你到城堡来，我要告诉你些事。”

第二天，进考场前，女孩特意来到了少年面前。“你后来看了那试卷吗?”她问。

“你说得对，”少年对女孩说，“昨天你走后，我试着做了做那些题，真的有些难，不过我借助参考书还是做出了一大半。你试过吗?”

女孩摇了摇头：“我英语没你好，不过我有张标准答案……”

这时入场铃响了，少年向女孩眨眨眼：

“别忘了我们的约会。”

他自信地向考场走去。

……

少年不知道自己是怎样来到小屋的。一离开考场他就开始拼命地跑啊跑，扔下后面监考老师诧异的目光、女孩惊慌的脸和一路上人们的迷惑，少年心中只有一个念头——跑，快跑——如果停下来他会控制不住自己。他到死都难以相信，昨天女孩带给他的试卷是真的!

当少年一看清试卷，他心里翻来覆去只剩下了两个念头——做?不做?做了，他昨天已经看过而且做过整套试卷，那就是作弊；但不做，他将会失去上重点高中的资格——而这又将影响到上大学……但他前几门考试据一个老师透露是年级里最好的，那些不如他却靠作弊取胜的家伙将取代他，他决不会甘心!短短10多分钟内，少年已大汗淋漓。他突然想起来，女孩，她也看过那试卷，而且她还有标准答案。少年转头向女孩看去，只一眼，他就被击倒了，女孩正在那儿以极熟练的速度书写着!

英语考试20分钟后，少年一字未写离开了考场。

少年不知自己在小屋里呆了多久，好长时间后他才意识到小屋里除了他还有人——是女孩，她来了已有一会了。

“那是给我的吗?”女孩轻轻地问。桌上摆着一个生日蛋糕，一边还放着张贺卡，贺卡打开着，正不知疲倦地一遍又一遍唱着生日歌曲。女孩微微有些变色，轻轻走到少年身边，“你昨天说要告诉我的就是这个吗?”

少年不吭声，良久，他微弱但坚定地问：

“你为什么要那样做？”

“我知道不该作弊，可你不做人家就会超过你，许多人都看过那份试卷。这不公平。”女孩急急解释。

然而少年还是那句问话：

“你为什么要那样做?”

女孩沉默了。

半晌，少年站了起来，他稳稳拿起贺卡，几下撕了个粉碎，又猛地把蛋糕推到了地上。

“你走。”他简短地说。

女孩看着少年做这一切，一声未吭。她最后站了起来，煞白着脸：

“你永远不知道该怎样在这个世界上生活。你只是活在自己的幻想里，把自己禁锢起来，不管外面发生了什么。对任何你无法正视的事，你只会逃避，只会……”她做了个猛烈的手势，“只会躲进这幢破屋子。你是个胆小鬼，我讨厌你，讨厌这地方……”她流着泪冲了出去。

这已是第四天了，父亲忧心忡忡地坐在少年身边。少年始终未开口说过话。自有人从大街上把少年送回家后，他就一直保持不吃不喝不说话的状态，尽管医生检查说除了有些精神不佳外，少年一切正常。

“爸，是你吗?”突然，少年轻轻地，但又清晰地开了口。

父亲心中涌起一股狂喜的感情。“是的，是我。一切都过去了，一切都很好。”父亲语无伦次，“告诉我，发生了什么事?”

少年摇了摇头：“没事。”他闭上了眼，轻轻地问：“爸，告诉我，你曾经有过梦吗?那些仅属于自己的梦想?”

父亲有那么一会儿似乎不知该说什么。很长时间来，他已不再在生活中考虑类似的问题了。他回忆着……良久，他点了点头。

“每个人都会有梦想，也都有过梦想。但随着时间的流逝，有些会消失，有些则会改变——这并不是坏事，就像不梦想并不是错误一样。关键是你要适应生活，没人能永远生活在自己的梦想中，任何梦想都不能成为逃避生活的借口。”

少年毕业了，他再没见着女孩，她上了重点高中，而他上的是一所普通高中，但他并没有如何沮丧，他已学会了很多东西，嗯，他成熟多了。

一天，少年很偶然地经过小屋，他看见那儿正有一队建筑工人在拆房。少年并不想去问那些工人——小屋的真正主人是谁，小屋当初为何得以保存而如今为什么拆去?在少年心中愿意永远保存这一个谜——神秘小屋就像当初不为人所知地存在一样，不为人所知地消失，它的存在似乎仅仅为了陪他走过一段少年梦幻时代。

少年想那个女孩，他很想告诉她，她有些话说对了，有那么一段时间，小屋是他逃避生活的伊甸园，但她不了解，小屋也是他固守心灵的一块净地。但现在，他已经不再需要小屋了，他需要经受生活的考验，他要上大学，当然还要结婚，他还要经历许许多多的人和事，而他也会永远固守那心灵净地——他已在心中筑起一座永不消失的小屋
