                              <p>for along time, putting stories/ journals of mine on the internet for everone to see is quite weird, but here it is, a start.</p>

<br />
<em>the room, translated from memory</em></p>

<p>after the bell rang, the boy charged out of school. he wanted to get away from his classmates so he walked around on purpose and then swiftly walked into a nearby park. the park is like every other park, no one really walk around in it and the only people who spend time in it is a few old people doing their daly excercise , the tai-chi, scattered doing their old people things. The boy ducked down and slipped into a short pile of bushes, suprisingly, there is a window right behind the bushes. he pushed over the window and inside it, is his own perosnal kingdom. </p>



<p>the room is only a few sqare feet big, probably a old abondoned storage room people has left behind and forgotten about. the boy only found out about it randomly trying to waiting out the rain. During the time there are pieces of scratch paper, crambled up magazines all over the place, the window frames are full of dust, a spider has already made his home onit. The corners of the house lies a broken coffee table and bambo chair with brooken seats. maybe beacause the owners thought they could always come back, they have left he door wide open, and the boy has gotten in with no trouble at all. the boy quickly realized that this was a abondoned place, on the coffee table, he even found a apir of keys thats full of dust. he kept his excitment down and shakendly tries to open the door with that pair of key, with a clicking sound lock bounced open. suddenly a exciting but absurb idea came to him, but it became more and more realistic as he thought about it more. this place is a place people left behind, forgotten about. he has found a piece of treasurly island, he could own it, a place of his and his alone. </p>



<p>the boy has enver realy gotten along with other children. when the other boys are playing in the street, he likes to spend most his time hanging around his mother. stutterly reading "the knights of the cross" while arguing who Zbyszko really loves. the boy remembered, while him and his mother discussed these things, her eyes are full of life and excitement, even though, his fatehr always have to obligatoryly say how come he is not out there playing soccer with the boys. the children in his neightbothood never really likeed him neither, whenever they see him walking by, words like "nerd" is spitted at him and following with with the sound of soccer and whistle. the boy is glad now he owns a kingdom of his own, his own world.</p>

<p>this day the boy has come to the room, wanting to write a letter for his mom. a year ago, he mother left him to go to the far far north. his parents was divoreced. mother really wanted to live with the boy, and the boy even told Mr. judge he wanted the same thing. but with a few words -- "no finicial capablity", the boys' dream is destoryed.</p>
 
<p>the boy lifts up his head, the voice of children playing and fooling arond came to him. from the look, anyone could tell that he really wanted to fit in and play with them. at the same time he knows the truth, if he appeared suddenly and ask to join them, however sincere he could be, the seclusion still exists. like the werid old man people has warn their kids about, living a few house down, snacks, cartoons, and toys could only work for so long. the boy never understood, not even his most loving mother could explain: why do the group of boys could allow themselves hanging with someone who spits whenever they fight, or even hanging with the crazy kid who bites randomly, but not him.</p>

<p> just like this, the boy has always come to his room of his. never could fit in, the longer he spents in the room, he realized that the only thin that could accpet him unconditionally is this room. he thought he could no longer live without this room, here he doesn't need anyone. no one could make him unhappy, no one could lecture him. here everything belongs to him. he lift up his hand, trying to write the letter, he wanted to say so much to his mom. the things they always talks about, the dreams he always imagined. he has never gotten close to father, he couldnt. his fater is always busy, busy coming in the house, busy eating, busy talking, even busy at getting mad at him. he kept on writng about the new friend he has made in his class, a transfer, hes new and just like the boy, without much friends. </p>


<p>along with a heavy sign, he put the letter in the very end of his desk drawer, in there are 20 something letters just like this one. he really wanted to send them out, he really do, but he can't, his father never told him where his mom lived. even the letter his mom send him, he has neer gotten to see them. the only thing that he could wish to dream about his mom is to write these letter behind his fathers back. </p>

<p> after been apart his mom for almost a year, he no longer feels the dreadness and hollowness. espcially when he made his new friend. as is life has gotten a lot more lively, visits to room became less and less.</p>

<p>the boy has brought a soccer ball --- today him and his new friend decided to play some socce. while kicking the ball mindlessly, his face shows some worries: should he telll his new friend about the secert room of his? think about all the things they could do in there, they could work on homework together, read, cook. the boy alwasy wanted to share the secert he has found, even thought he wrote letters to his mom about it, but the letters could never reach her hands, and the room only ever his lonely shadow. he even thought about telling his friend about the room a few times, but never found himself sayingit out lout. after awhile hes decided during break he could bring his friend along, then it wont attact so much atttention.</p>

<p>the friend is already waiting on him at the soccer field, he saw the boy running to him with excitement and said "great!, hey look there are poeple here playing too!"</p>
<p>a frown begin to appear on the boy's face. it is the group of boys, they still wound twant to hang with the boy, even thought they werent as hostile as they were before. but rejction has become normal to the boy and he has found himself in the same position he was not so long ago</p>

<p>"lets go over there and play", the boy points at a small empty field on the other side of the crowd.</p>

<p>"why not play with them?" the friend asks with some couriosity "isnt it more fun?"</p>

<p> the boy looks down at the ball, he wants to explain why, but dont know where to start. at last, a low and quiet voice murmurs out "I never play with them."</p>

<p>that day, it's the first time the two did not have much fun. especailly the friend, always seems like his occupied with something else on his mind, a few time the ball has been kicked almost purposely over the fence. and when the boy has pick up the ball he saw his fried laughing with the group of boys...</p>

<p> a week later.</p>

<p>the boy is watching TV, and the father is flippig through the paper. </p>

<p>"that friend of yours, you know the tall looking boy, how come i dont see him often anymore?" the fatehr asked carelessly "i saw him almost everyday before.</p>

<p>the boy made no noise, and only turned the television louder.</p>

<p>the father looks at the back of the boy, he has seen it before. almost immidiately he realized what has happened between the two.</p>

<p>the father werent so happy with his discorvery, he wanted to say something, but didn't. the boy must walk on his own, if he cant even find a friend, how coudl he even stand in this more and more competitive society. but the fahter has gotten a little tired of his lecturing. maybe it is better to let the boy learn some lessons, he is still young, and what is painful to him now might not be after a few years for him to look back. it would be better for him learn the hard lessons now then later. </p>
 
<p>the father wasnt wrong, the boy distant himself with his friend.</p>ã€‚

<p>the friend has quickly found his place withthe group of boys. hes not a bad looking lad, and even knows how to whistle, the boys in the neightborhood accpeted him almost immediately. of course the boy didnt break his friendship apart right then and there, after a long time of lonelynes he cared for the friendshi between him and his friend, and he cant help but to play with his firend and the group of boys, he it's so clear to him that his friend no longer look at the boy the same way as before. even when they are playing ball, the new friend starts to purposely make the boy pick up lose balls over the fence, even though they kick it over.</p>

<p>the last draw happened in school.</p>

<p>it's actually over a rather small and simple thing. during the time the boy was cleaning the black board, it's the friends duty that day to clean up, but looking at eh clock noticing it's almost tiem for the next class already, his friend is still talking swiftly to the girls, nociting it doesnt seem like it's going  stop, the boy trid to clean for his friend. while stading on the lecture podium, the boy clearly saw that his friend noticed him, and tunred around pretend not to notice him and continued his conversation with the girls. </p>

<p>it's schools rules that 3 minutes before the bell rings, no one should be walking in the class room, but beacause the cleaning took a little while, the boy walked to his desk a luttle late, right on time when the teacher walked in. the boy's teacher is   strict middle age woman, paid especial attention to the rules of the school. as soon as she saw him, the face has turned gloomy, "the class has already begun, what are you doing wondering around?"
the boy has always been sacered of the lady, he studdtterly said "i was just trying to clean the black board." </p>

<p> of the teacher was to let it go, nothing else was goning to happen, but she have a particular sharp memory and hated people lying. she raised her eyebrows and said "it's not your duty to clean the class today." the boy got nervous, he tried to explain" I was trying to do it for someone else..." " alright alright" she's getting impatient, jeered "oh so you were jsut trying to be a goos samaritan huh, then i shouldve congradulated you". after what she said he walked off and begin today's class.</p>

<p>the teacher obviously meant taht this will be the end of this. she didnt bother to quesiton it furthur. to her she has already let the boy go. but out of her expectation, the boy didnt jsut walk off, rather the opposite, he came up, said nervously but with a sense of certainty " i really was trying to help someone else doing their duty, if you dont blieve it, ask him", then the boy points at his friend, the friend didnt bother to stand up, not even mentioning to apologize. the teacher now is really getting mad, she harshly sid to the boy "you back to your seat now, and come to my office after class, this is rideiculous, lying to my face like that."</p>

<p>in the end the truth finally float out, the teacher even appologize dto the boy afte class for making assumptions about him, also punished the friend, and the friend tied to explain huimself by saying taht he only thought this was really nothing big, not worth stading over and answer for. to the boy, he could never forgive the friend for what he did, how could he? how could he forgive someone who has betrayed him when he was most needed. to the boy, the other dont deserve to be his friend. </p>

<p>sometimes the boy thought, the other boy never really wanted his friendshiip form the gecko, the other boy only befriended him because he was new in town, the otehr boy never really like him. the only thing the boy was glad about was that he didnt tell the other boy about his secert room. after what had happened, the boy cherished even more about his secert-the room shares his lonelyness with him, it keeps secerts for him, it fills the void in his life. only the room is dependable, it will never betary, never be lost.</p>

<p>it's the last of the middle, the boy was the same as before, standing apart from the crowd, even though he has changed alot. his taller now than his father, ther are evena few light sruffs above his lips, he is still strangly unsociablt as before, doesnt really join any extracurricular activities. it seems like he was only living in his world of imaginations, everything he did and the relationships he had with the outside world, however close it might seem, there is a invisible wall between him and the rest. the thing that he does the most in the room was writing. </p>

<p>as time went on, the boy start to guess why the room was even here in the first place. he imagined one day maybe he is boiling soup or something, someone will suddenyl appear, and they will say taht this room will be for public, the room will be torn down and rebuilt-- the idea of that is too real and cruel for him. so the boy starts to change a new hypothesis, maybe the door opens, there will be a woman, she was returning to her hometown and to this place of hers, full of her memory, maybe she would be foudnign her old diary or pictures or soemthing, maybe when she opens the door she will be shocked to see the boy, and then, he would walk up to her and say... everytime when he gets to this part, the boy could never imagine what he would say to the woman, maybe he could invite her to lve with him in this room, does it counts as a marraige then? thats too random and rediculous. the boy love to daydream about things like this, and even sometimes, the dreams he had, even he was stuned by it. he would would start to record all of it down. one day, while he was crazyly writing down his thought, he suddnely thoght this is what he should be: a writer.</p>

<p>the idea infested him, he would try to write short stories, and starts to use his free time in school to write. but this was discoveredd by his teacher very quickly. what supriesd the boy was the mindless suppression she have. not only did she took away two months worth of his work, she even called his fatehr about this sayig that it is" random, not a promising future, a extemely stupid idea". when the boy got home, the father apprehended him furiously </p>

<p>"you dont possibly think you could making a living out of this do you? why dont you ever just be normal and do your school work and leave it at that? it's your mom, it's her giving you stupid ideas like these when you are young. doing some usleess shit like this"</p>

<p>the boy tried to hold down his anger, lowering his head and didnt even made a sound. the second day he moved eveything in his room to the room. he begin to ditch class, spend days in there writing. the boy's grade became adownward slope, if nothing else happens, these life of seclusion may really take a toll on him. </p>

<p>the first thing of highschool is seperating classes, the advanced class and the regular class. the seperation of classes also mixed people around. the boy has made it to the advanced class, the classmates he had before are no longer with him. the boy was not reminiscient about it, he was quite pleased with it, the class he had before always made fun of him for his peculiarity. after making it to the advance class, everyone is so busy studying no one had the time make fun of him, not to mention talking at all with one another. he had more freedom than before. the new deskmate of his is a girl from a different class. the boy never liked to talk , and the girl like everyone else, care nothing else but o study. after a month or two, besides borrowing an eraser or asking for a difficult question, the boy and his deskmate never made any further in their relationship.</p>

<p>maybe the boy and the girl could jsut live peacfully like this, the occasion conversation and graduate with a distant relationship. but this was not the case.</p>

<p>it was a afternoon, after being jailled for half a day the boys did not even care to eat lunch, they are playing the fields. the girls are coupliig around and talking about the newest movie and making small conversations here and there. the boy is stting in the classroom along, slashing his pen around on the paper. a group of voice came outside of the window, a few words flow in the boy's ear, it was about him. he couldnt help but to eavedrop their conversation.</p>

<p>even thought the boy never really talks to anyone, the uniqueness of him not being around the crowd in the two months made the rest of the class intersted in him. some curious girls even asked about he boy from his former classmates. the group of voice was talking about how the boy was trying to helping someelse doinng their duty and got in trouble, starting to write novels out of the blue. as time went on, the boy has gotten more mad, he wanted to ran outside and teach those people how to mind their own business. but he thought about it and only chuckled with a sense of helplessness, he knew if he did anything, it will only be new material for people to talk about behind his back. for a long a time now he has forgiven those who misunderstood. but a voic, a defending voice suddenly came in the group of voices:</p>

<p>"i don think it was so funny what he did? he's pretty cool and quiet, and kind of smart. thats maybe just how he is. i saw one of his stories, legit one of the better stories ive read, probably the best writer in our class... "</p>

<p>it;s only after awhile did the boy realize that it was a voice of his deskmate, the girl. he remembered that the there was one time where he brought in his story to class trying fix the ending, he left it on his desk before going out, and when he came back the draft was out of order and all over the desk, at the time he thought it was the wind. the boy couldve never imagined it was her, someone who has only sit by him for 2 months, total of 100 word exchanged between the two, she knows him better than eveyrone else and even like his stories! everyone else has only ever rooted against him and anything that he did, the girl is the only one who stood on his side and given him some sympathy.  </p>


<p>from then on the boy saw something in her eyes, something undescribable. he starts to talk to her more and more. he doesnt go to the room often now, he enjoy spending more of his time with her in the room studying, the boringness he tried to get away from is not so boring now. even when they dont talk much, just sitting next to her has made him happy. and the girl also felt something, she didnt try to avoid it neither, but rather hang around with a naturally with some confidence</p>

<p>one day,, the girl was trying out a new fountain pen. perhaps something was blocking the ink, she shook it immpatiently, a string of ink flow out, right on to the boy's shirt. it was  new shirt and the stream of ink sure made its mark on it.  </p>

<p>the girl said anxiously "i.. i will bring the shirt and clean it for you, dont worry, i will give it to you perfectly clean tomorrow. alright?"</p>

<p>of course the boy agreed</p>

<p>the second day the girl came back with clean shirt, to his suprise, the mark was really gone, like it had never happened.</p>

<p>"wow you are good, whenver i geta  mark on my shirts, the washing machine never washes it off." the boy said with praise.</p>

<p>"the washing machines doesnt work on these kind of things", the girl told him "i used bits of rice to clean this, and then wash it three times in luke warm water."</p>

<p>"you wash it by hand?"</p>

<p>"yeah, my mom told me when i was young, you cant wash it with the machine, it's gotta be by hand." the girl said carelessly.</p>

<p>"how lucky". the boy signed. "my mom left when i was in elementray school, she enver taught nme this." the boy push out a smile, "dontn laugh at this, but i still have so many shirts with ink on them, all piling up in my closet."</p>

<p>the girl looks at the boy, didnt know what to say. something poped into her head.</p>

<p>"hey", she said half jokingly" being them to me, let me try, maybe you can still wear them, but you have to thank me then, she said with a bright and lovely smile.</p>

<p>the time when the girl gave those clean clothes to the boy, he was moved. he knows beside his mom, shes the first one that cared for him. he felt the something in him, the same feeling when he found the room. the boy as decided to give something darely to her, after a while prepareation, he has brought her to the room one afternoon.</p>

<p>it was the end of march, the weather is still cool, but when the sunlight hits on the body there is warmth. outside the window there are eye full of green, and from time to time the churps from birds</p>

<p>the girl followed the boy crowlling thorugh the bushes, she was stuned. she"wow! this is.." she's circling around the room while saying "so.. so you been hidin here the whole time? no wonder n one ever see you, youve been here the whole time!</p>

<p>the boy's face turned slighly red "you cant tell anyone else about this"</p>

<p>yeah, this is between us. whos house is this anyways?"</p>

<p>"i dont know" the boy said "ever since i found this place i have never seem any other around"</p>

<p>that afternnoon, the boy spend what is his best moments in his life here, in the room. they were sipping on coffee while reading drafts of the boy's stories. looking at birds flying around their nests, the the girls laughter, the room became ever more lively.</p>

<p>at night, the boy just had finished eating, the phone ring, it was the girl " i have something to show you" they are really close already. she often comeby his room, the two study and if they got tired, they just joke around for awhile. </p>

<p>she was sitting beside the coffee table.</p>

<p>"whats this?" the boy is flipping through a stack of paper next to her.</p>

<p>this is the english portion of the this year's test." the unified testing fromm highschool to college hhas become a battle of death. and eveyr year the there will always be a dozen of papers pop up, whoever has it always say that it is the actaul test, bidding high prices for it. the unify testing has already begun for two days, tomorrow is the last day, it wil be the english portion.</p>

<p>"you believe this too?" the boy shrugged his shoulders "these things are always fake. didnt the ones came out two days ago people said it fake too?"</p>

<p>the girl is trying hard explaining herself " but this one is probably real, someone who works in the departmant of education gave this to my mom".</p>

<p>"so what if it;s real? I dont want it anyways" the boy flipped through a few pages carelessly "i'm sure this is fake, two days ago i saw it at someone else's house, dont even waste your time with this."</p>

<p>legit? the girl didnt know to believe it or not " it doenst hurt to look at it, i glimpse it through it was kind of hard, a lot of it covers things we didnt even learn."</p>

<p>"alright, i will look at it when i have the time", the boy look at the girl secertively " come to the castle tomorrow, i have something to tell you.</p>

<p>the second day, right before going into take toe test, the girl found him " did you ever look at those tests? she asks.</p>

<p>"you were right" the boy said "after you left, i tried to do those problems, it was actaullly ahrd, but the refrence book i had really helped, i did half, did yyou try to do it?"</p>

<p>the girl shook her head "my english it's never as good as yours, but i have a answers..."</p>

<p>the bell rang, the boy winked at her.</p>

<p>" dont foreget our date"</p>

<p>he walked into the testing room ever so confidently.</p>

<p>.....</p>

<p>he doesnt remember how he even got to the room. after leaving the test room he just ran with all he have. leaving the insturctor's piculair face,  the girls' suprise behind. the whole time there is only one thing corssing his mind-- run, he could not believe it, not in a billion years, the test se gave him was real!</p>

<p>when the boy saw the test his heart only have two thought-- should he do it? or not? if he did, then obviously it's cheating; if he didnt he will lose the opportunity to go to a good college-- then it will effect his chance for a good job.. his teach ahs already told him he have th best grade in his year, but he might be replaced by those who do wel by cheats...in the short 10 minutes the boy was drenched in sweat. he suddenly remembered, the girl, she saw the test, and she have the asnwers. he turned around to her, she was writing the answers down with confidence. </p>

<p>after 20 minutes, he walked out of there with nothing on his papers</p>

<p>he doesnt know how long he has been in the room, but after sometime saw that beside him she was in the room too, and clearly she has been there for awhile already</p>

<p>"is that for me?" she asked quietly. in the shadowy room there was a cake, beside it a birthday cake , the card is wide open, tirelessly playin the birthday some over and over. she lightly walked to him "is this what you are talking about yesterday?"</p>

<p>the boy didnt make a sound, but after a bit he murmured something quietly but surely </p>

<p>"why?"</p>

<p>i know i shouldnt cheat, but if you dont do it someone will always be ahead of you, a lot of people has already seen that test, it's not fair" the girl is tripping over her words trying to explain herself.</p>

<p>still, he repeated what he said before look stright head, through her and everything in the room.</p>

<p>"why?"</p>

<p>"why did you do it?"</p>

<p>she turned quiet</p>

<p>the boy stood up, steadily ripped the card apart, and pushed the cake away. </p>

<p>seemingly, this has happened to him one too many times</p>

<p>"get out"</p>

<p>she watched him the whole time, never made a sound. then she stood up too, her face turned white</p>

<p>"you.. you never knew how to live in the world, you are living in your little dreams of yours, you trapped yourself in it. nevermind what happens to the outside world, you cant ever see things as what they are, all you ever do it just run away. thats all..." she did something violently with her hand "... you are a coward, i hate you, hate this god damn place..." she burst out of the room, with somethin dripping from her face. under the the bright sunlight, thats the only thing he could ever see</p>

<p>this is the forth day now, the father is sitting by the boy full of worries. the boy nevver talked, not since he was sent home by someone on the streets. he didnt eat, didnt drink, didnt make a sound. even though the doctor said the boy is experiecne some kind of depression, everything else is perfectly normal.</p>

<p>"dad, is it you? all the sudden, he talk, squeezed these words out of him.</p>

<p>the father felt something in his throat, a rush of relief. "hey hey, it's me, everything is okay now." the father no longer know whats coming out of his mouth, saying evveything he could at once. " tell me, it's ok, tell me what happened?"</p>

<p> the boy lightly sook his head "nothing", he then closed his eyesm, lightly asks "hey dad, did you ever have dreams? dreams of your own?"</p>

<p>the father was stuck, because for the longest time, he doesnt ask himslef those things anymore. after while of sorting throughhis memory.. after a while, he nodded his head</p>

<p>everyone will have a dream, or maybe had one. but slowly, these things will disappear, thing will change-- but it doesnt mean it's a bad thing, just like there is nothing wrong with having no dreams at all. whats inmportant is that you must live regardless. no one could ever live their dreams fully, no dreams could be an excuse to get out of the reality of life.</p>

<p>the boy graduated. he never saw her again, she went on to a famous college, he was never beaten about it, he has learned lot, yeah, he has grown alot since.</p>

<p> one day, by some chancem the boy walked by the room, he saw there was a constrcution company there breaking it apart. he never wanted to ask whos house it really belongs to. why it is there for so long secertly. to him that should remain as a mystery- the room should be there mysteryly and be destored mysteriously, the existence of the room seems like the existence of his childhood.</p>

<p>he really wanterd to her that she was right about something, for sometime the room was his escape, his little paradise. but what she doesnt understand is taht the room is something pure piece of land deep in his heart. now, he doesnt need the room anymore, he has much more to walk in his life, college, the life after college, and mirrage, he will be walking many tough things in life, but to him there will always be that room-- a room that will never disappear.</p>
