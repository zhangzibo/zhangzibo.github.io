	<title>a solo trip in lake berryessa after the rejection</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>i am writing currently under a bridge near lake berryessa. 
it was just a few days ago where i was notified that i was no longer a student at my university due my my academic stands. i have not yet told anyone and do no plan to. but somehow i had decided it was a good idea to bike for 3 hours under the blazing sun all the way to lake berryessa. </p>

<p>i had thought about many things on the way here. though i was mostly trying ot catch my breath and hold on to my slowly fading vision. i wonder if this set vack is wat will ultimately drives me to be the person i usually see in movies. not the protagonist in the middle of the conflict but a side character who was driven mad with his circumstances and remain a outcast for the rest of his life.
</p>

<p>how should i tell my parents what happened? not that i am afraid of what they will think of me but it wuold be at that moment where i would have to face myself. i dont want to do that. however sociopathic i am, a failure is a failure. 
</p>

<p>maybe i wanted to fail, no, thats rediculous. but maybe i wanted to, subconciously. maybe the dreams of studying in berkeley has already been destoryed, and i thought i ought to destory this one as well. </p>

<p>is there a deeper meaning of what had happened to me? maybe. it will be whatever i want it to be. meaning or meaningless i must face the fact that it had happened.</p>

<p>what will happedn to me then? what will i do? summer school? sure. is there a chance for me to transfer to CMU? yes only as a miracle. </p>

<p>for the life of mine i had always thought i was special. well i think everyone thought they are special. they are. but i am more. every great minds that had came to this place and gone all have onething in common. loneliness. i have alwasy been lonly but am i one of those people? i cant quite put a finger on it but i think i am. maybe because i read a lot. maybe becasue i love to think. maybe i am aware of everything around me. </p>

<p>if i had a chance to choose between these two things. one is to live a life of hapiness, true hapiness, which is also equavilent to a life of true  ignorance. the other one is konwlege, knowing the painful truth that nothing really matters, ok tahts a little too real.no one is really going to want to beleive that. knowing that everything is relative. and our doings is so minial and so irrelivent, the chance of any of us gain notiriouty is purelly based on luck. which one would i choose? the sad truth or the igorant happiness? maybe i could cheat and take half of each. but how could anyone live a happy life knowing the truth? maybe thats why people have idols. maybe thats why people have their getaways. the work they enjoy, the relationship they have, the games they play, the alchohole they drink, the drugs they do. it's all a getaway. </p>

<p>even more so, which on would you choose? if you are ignorant now, would you choose to remain taht way and be happy? or would you choose to be mediocore intelligent and always have that sense of insecurity and lost of hoope in the back of your head.</p>


<p>no maybe the importance of the choices is not the outcome but the choices themselves, realzing that there is no differnece between an action and inaction. we choose to do something base on almost no reason. however convincing a reason could be at the moment it really is nothing in the grand scheme of things. </p>

<p>why would people then, regret their inactions? are they regreting on what could have been? is it not just as the same as the action they took?</p>

<p>is that a coward way of thinking? i dont know. i think the there is a distinction between doing nothing because the ultimate outcome will be the same than doing something and doing nothing becasue the they just giveup, scared maybe, lazy maybe. they are the same inaciton are not powered by the same reason. just as people doing the same thing sometimes. the reason behhind it all is diffrent, however similar it is on the surface.</p>

<p>nontheless, i must keep going, the same reason why i should stop going. i want to know the truth. i do. i want to learn. i do. i want to know. i do. </p>

<p>there are always penlty of life lessons people say. the great grand ideals people bable ona about, each comefrom a diffrenct place. each have its own origin. it will come full circle when the itme comes to make a dicision. jsut know taht whatever you choose, you should, and only could have concern about what will happen for the next hour or week. never furthur. </p>
