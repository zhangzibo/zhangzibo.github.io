<p>i remember kirkgaard said something like this 
	"Marry, and you will regret it; don’t marry, you will also regret it; marry or don’t marry, you will regret it either way. Laugh at the world’s foolishness, you will regret it; weep over it, you will regret that too; laugh at the world’s foolishness or weep over it, you will regret both. Believe a woman, you will regret it; believe her not, you will also regret it… Hang yourself, you will regret it; do not hang yourself, and you will regret that too; hang yourself or don’t hang yourself, you’ll regret it either way; whether you hang yourself or do not hang yourself, you will regret both. This, gentlemen, is the essence of all philosophy.”</p>
<p>i wonder this vast uncertain world uncertainty is really what drives people to make choices, there are really no bad choices or good choices, good and bad is only subjective. rather the action and inaction will casue regrets. maybe thataas people often say they should live with no regrets, they probably rather would like to make rational bad decisions than regreting what could have been.</p>

<p>but here raises the question, is that really a better way of living? if one were to know that all that there is in weather making a decision or not both the outcome is uncertain, then what difference does it really make? a even more so of an question, if one were to intentionally make a somewhat rational decision that he think he would probably regret, would that really matter?</p>

<p>i dare say weather one would like it or not living itself is full of uncertaities. bgiven the certainty of death and failure. thats like play russian rouletter until the bullets runs out with just yourself. you can certainly take your chances to decide weatehr to pull the trigger or not. if you pull all 5 times and didnt die, that's an intresting life. if you pull one the possiblity of dying is just as good as the one who pulls it all 5 times given all the possiblities. if someone pull it once and died then what, is that a so honorble life? no, it would considered as a sad one. if someone were not to pull the trigger at all. no one does that. becasue they dont they will die instantly, thats just how life is, someone on the side pushing another loaded gun pointing at you making you play the game</p>

<p>there are many people who know that fact and and said "so what, just live life of good and decent, it is the humanity that counts." i remember that clearly in the works of hemmingway, there arent mockery and irony, no humor in his work becasue he beleives everything taht is true and decent is good. </p>

<p>why is that? what could possibliy be the reason why he could endure knowing that fact and still live with faith? theology offeres faith but a blind one. faith is strong virus, a addictive good drug that takes the pain away but never solves the problem.</p>

<p>what are false idols? is knowlege a false idol? is solitude a false idol? is blanking out a false idol? </p>

<p>as years change i can start sense the repeat of the lost generation, not between the wars, something worse, lost in peace.</p>

<p>there is no light to look forward to, becasue theres light everywhere. mediocracy and postmodernism has filled in people's mind, and they demonstate it very social subconciously.
the glorifiing obscure memes, the ever changing form of social relationships.i cant tell is speeding things up is a good thing or a bad thing.</p>

<p>what will happen in 30 years, what will the social construst be then? will be the new normality then? that is the question people must ask themslves, people need not to be a prophet to see the future, they only need to be wise</p>

<p>why do i keep on thinkging these kind of things, knowing and not knowing of these things doesnt mean anything, knowing will be suffering because there cant be doings. and not knowing is possible. noo fking wonder there are 7 deadly sins, why the fuck would people care so much about living withink the commandments if there will be suffering anyways.</p>

<<p>i wonder if other people think about the same thing, wonder if those superficial beight people ever thinkg about things like this. if they do why are they like that? they must dont know. what about people who think about this kind of stuff, how have they not killed themselve yet? why havent i killed myself yet? the sins are keeping me alive. the sins are whats keeping me alive. </p>

<p>ironic no? the more alive i want to be the more i need to want the sins. what should i have faith in? the nigga in the sky or something semi-godly, or even millions things eathly.</p>
